1. Move coords in gui are random? Pls Advise
2. Check win before next player makes move; break, if happens (maybe fixed?)
3. Fix AI heuristic to work on smaller boards
4. Disable start button after initial press (code is there, search "MASON" and "ADVISE", but startbtn is the wrong label - i don't know which is correct.)
5. Fix win checking if it's still broken - doesn't display text properly
